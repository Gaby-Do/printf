- small printf wannabe

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B _printf

.RB int printf(const char *restrict format, ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B _printf
.PP
The functions _printf produce output according to a format as described below. It writes output to stdout. More information on the tasks performed is explained below:
The functions writes the output under the control of a format string that specifies how subsequent arguments (or arguments accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of stdarg(3)) are converted for output.

.SH CONVERSION SPECIFIERS
.TP
.B c - 
.PP
The argument must be a char. For example the out put for _printf("%c", 'H') would be H.

.TP
.B s - 
.PP
The argument must be a string. For example the out put for _printf("%s", "Hello") would be Hello.

.TP
.B d, i - 
.PP
For printing a decimal or an integer. The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

.TP
.B o, u, x, X - 
.PP
The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned octal (o), unsigned decimal (u), or unsigned hexadecimal (x and X) notation.  The letters abcdef are used for x conversions; the letters ABCDEF are used for X conversions. 


.SH FORMAT OF THE FORMAT STRING
.IP
.PP
The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any.  The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.  Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier.  (WORK IN PROGRESS: In between there may be (in this order) zero or more flags, an optional minimum field width, an optional precision and an optional length modifier.)
The overall syntax of a conversion specification is:

%[$][flags][width][.precision][length modifier]conversion


.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
.B
Success - Upon successful return, this functions returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).

.TP
.B
Error - If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.
